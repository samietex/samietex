### Hi there 👋

**Welcome to my GitHub profile...I know what you are here for🌚...Hear me out...I am a Data Analyst, and here's why😀**

#### About Me 💻 📊

I am a Data Analyst with experience using Python, Power BI, and SQL for data extraction, wrangling, cleaning, transformation, modeling, analysis, and visualization.

I specifically use Power BI for building reports and dashboards that communicates insights in a more structured way. You can check out some of my [Power BI projects](https://community.powerbi.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/289450) 

I also use Python and other Python libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib.pyplot, Seaborn, Keras, Tensorflow, etc. for building data preprocessing, feature engineering, and for building machine learning/deep learning models.

Currently, I am working on personal projects, creating related contents and open to collaborations and remote contract jobs.
