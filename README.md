### Hi there, üëã

**Welcome to my GitHub profile...Thanks for stopping by.**

#### About Me üíª üìä

Hello guys, I am Samuel Shaibu. I do a bit of data analysis and machine learning, so I can refer to myself as a data scientist. Over the years, I have gathered expertise and experience with tools and programming languages like Python, Power BI, and SQL. I have built personal projects surrounding data extraction, wrangling, cleaning, transformation, modeling, analysis, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and visualization.

I graduated with a bachelor of science degree from the department of mechanical engineering at the University of Ibadan. My final year project was on energy grid optimization using deep machine learning, where I am building multiple deep learning models for detecting faults and forecasting load demand. The objective of the project also encompasses building a tracker dashboard using Microsoft Power BI for IBEDC.

I specifically use Power BI for building reports and dashboards that communicate insights in a more structured way. You can check out some of my [Power BI projects](https://community.powerbi.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/289450) 

I also use Python and other Python libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib.pyplot, Seaborn, Keras, Tensorflow, etc. for building data preprocessing, feature engineering, machine learning, and deep learning models.

Currently, I am working on personal projects and creating related content, and I am open to collaborations and remote contract jobs.
